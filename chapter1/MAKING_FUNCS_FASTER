Keep the function exactly the same, the only difference being that instead of passing
by value or even a pointer, if the ammount of arguments add up to more than 8 bytes,
make a struct that contains all the information that needs to be passed, and then pass
that struct as a pointer. In this way you will have to copy only the address of the struct
so it will ussually be faster and will also usually use more space. Downside? Readability
But it is not significant. If there are enough args, it might not be a bad idea.
